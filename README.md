Neural Style Transfer with Streamlit :

This project implements a neural style transfer application using TensorFlow and Streamlit. The application allows users to blend the content of one image with the style of another, producing a stylized output image that combines the unique characteristics of both input images.

Features:

Streamlit User Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
Image Preprocessing and Deprocessing: Functions to preprocess input images for the VGG19 model and deprocess the generated image to display the final result.
Content and Style Loss Computation: Custom functions to compute content loss and style loss using the VGG19 model.
Example Artworks: Demonstration images to showcase the capabilities of the style transfer algorithm.

Usage :

Upload a content image and a style image using the interface.
Click the "Apply Style Transfer" button to generate the stylized image.
View and download the final stylized image.

Acknowledgments :

The VGG19 model is used for feature extraction, based on the original paper by Simonyan and Zisserman.
Special thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable resources and inspiration.
